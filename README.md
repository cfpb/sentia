# Sentia
#### Enlightenment for your Environment
THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

Sentia is project focused on visualizing cloud infrastructure. The initial version of the tool will support a nested view of the Netflix Edda API. Future features include a filtering tool, and time-based views of data.

Sentia provides a simple way for stakeholders across your teams to see instructure, determine changes over time, and quickly view status and details about each instance in your cloud.
